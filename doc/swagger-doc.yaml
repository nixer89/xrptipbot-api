  title: XRPTipBot API Specification
  description: |
   This API is a full mirror of the [XRPTipBot API](https://www.xrptipbot.com/json/feed) by [@WietseWind](https://twitter.com/WietseWind).<br>
   The API feed is updated every 60 seconds. This new API was built to enhance the querying capabilities for @xrptipbot transactions.
   
   You can use every JSON field of the feed as query parameter. Additionally these query params are supported\:<br><br>
   '<b>from_date=2019-02-01 00:03:00</b>' => to pick tips only from that date/time on<br>
   '<b>to_date=2019-02-01 00:03:00</b>' => to pick tips only until that date/time<br>
   '<b>limit=10</b>' => to limit the returned number of tips<br>

   Additionally, to speed up the requests even more, you can define a list of result fields you want to retreive in the response.<br>
   Usually the API returns the whole JSON object of the XRPTipBot-Transaction. But most likely you don`t need all the fields. So you can specify which fields you want!<br>
   The query param is called 'result_fields' and you can define the fields included in your respone, divided by comma. As Example\:<br>
   '<b>result_fields=moment,user,to,xrp</b>' -> this will return you just those 4 defined JSON properties in the response.<br>
   Try it out with this request\:<br>
   [Last 10 tips WietseWind has received](https://api.xrptipbot-stats.com/feed?to=WietseWind&limit=10&result_fields=moment,user,to,xrp)

   As the original XRPTipBot-Feed built by [@WietseWind](https://twitter.com/WietseWind), the API provides it`s data in a decending manner, ordered by date.
