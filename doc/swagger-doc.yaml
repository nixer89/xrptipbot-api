  title: XRPTipBot API Specification
  description: |
   This API is a full mirror of the XRPTipBot API [https://www.xrptipbot.com/json/feed](https://www.xrptipbot.com/json/feed) by [@WietseWind](https://twitter.com/WietseWind).<br>
   The API feed is updated every 30 seconds (not real time). The original API provides limited capabilities and therefore this new API was built.
   
   You can use every JSON field of the original feed as query parameter + additionally these query params\:<br>
   'from_date=2019-02-01 00:03:00' => to pick tips only from that date/time on<br>
   'to_date=2019-02-01 00:03:00' => to pick tips only until that date/time<br>
   'limit=10' => to limit the returned number of tips

   As the original XRPTipBot-Feed built by [@WietseWind](https://twitter.com/WietseWind), the API provides it`s data in a decending manner, ordered by date.
